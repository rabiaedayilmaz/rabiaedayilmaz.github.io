# Welcome ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡

Heyy, I hope you're doing well! 

My name is Rabia Eda Yılmaz and biomedical engineering undergrad at Yildiz Technical University. Since my youngster times, I am deep into the science, art, languages, and books. Therefore, here is where I intend to construct and shape my virtual world by my notes, art, scribbles or codes.

I like to see any spark of intelligence, so do not hesitate to contact me and please, maybe attach a relevant quote to the top from someone :).
