# Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks

Chain of Thoughts Prompting = CoT and Program of Thougts = PoT. CoT models are language models that are used to produce text describing reasoning and computation, so that answering a question. On the other hand, PoT is used to generate text and programming language, so that an answer to a question. PoT is evaluated on 5 math word and financial-QA dataset problems in both few-shot and zero-shot setting. Concluded that PoT has 12% performance gain overall.
