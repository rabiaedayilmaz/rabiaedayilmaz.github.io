## Background and Methods
### Brief History of Cognitive Neuroscience
The scientific field of cognitive neuroscience received its name in the late 1970s (cognition - process of knowing, neuroscience - the study of how nervous system is organized and functions). The ancient Greeks who made the theoretical leap to the view that we are separate fr om the world we occupy. Thales represented *monism* flesh-and-blood brain produces thoughts, however Descartes represented *dualism* body is like a machine and mind is nonmaterial, also influences body. Cognitive neuroscience takes Thales' perspective: conscious mind is a product of the brain's physical activity and not seperate from it.

Thomas Willis foreshadowed cognitive neuroscience with the notion that isolated brain damage (biology) could affect behavior (psychology), but his insights slipped from view. So, he is the first one that showed brain damage can influence behavior and cerebral cortex might what makes us human.

Joseph Gall became convinced that the brain was the organ of the mind and that innate faculties were localized in specific regions of the cerebral cortex. He thought that the brain was organized around some 35 or more specific functions, ranging from cognitive basics such as language and color perception to more ephemeral capacities such as affection and a moral sense, and that each was supported by specific brain regions.

Gall believed that a careful analysis of the skull could go a long way in describing the personality of the person inside the skull. Gall called this technique anatomical personology -> phrenology.

Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens destroyed parts of the brains of pigeons and rabbits and observed what happened. deducted the notion that the whole brain participated in behavior -> aggregate field theory. He wrote "All
sensations, all perceptions, and all volitions occupy the same seat in these (cerebral) organs. The faculty of sensation, percept and volition is then essentially one faculty."

John Hughlings Jackson began to publish his observations on the behavior of persons with brain damage. He proposed topographic organization in the cerebral cortex.

Paul Broca had a patient Tan. He could understand language, but “tan” was the only word he could utter. Broca found that Tan had a syphilitic lesion in his left -hemisphere inferior frontal lobe. Th is region is now called Broca’s area.

Carl Wernicke reported on a stroke victim who (unlike Broca’s patient) could talk quite freely but made little sense when he spoke. Wernicke’s patient also could not understand spoken or written language. He had a lesion in a more posterior region of the left hemisphere, an area in and around where the temporal and parietal lobes meet, now referred to as Wernicke’s area.

Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig electrically stimulated discrete parts of a dog brain and observed that this stimulation produced characteristic movements in the dog.

Germans neuroanatomists analyze the brain by using microscopic methods to view the cell types in different brain regions. Perhaps the most famous of the group was Korbinian Brodmann, who analyzed the cellular organization of the cortex and characterized 52 distinct regions. Then, he published his cortical maps in 1909.

Brodmann used tissue stains that permitted him to visualize the different cell types in diff erent brain regions. How cells diff er between brain regions is called cytoarchitectonics, or cellular architecture.

Camillo Golgi developed one of the most famous cell stains in the history of the world: the silver method for staining neurons—la reazione nera, “the black reaction”—which impregnated individual neurons with silver chromate. This stain permits visualization of individual neurons in their entirety. Golgi had believed that
the whole brain was a syncytium, a continuous mass of tissue that shares a common cytoplasm.

Using Golgi's method, Santiago Ramón y Cajal went on to find that neurons were discrete entities. Ramón y
Cajal, who some call the father of modern neuroscience, was the first to identify the unitary nature of neurons and to articulate what came to be known as the neuron doctrine, the concept that the nervous system
is made up of individual cells. He also recognized that the transmission of electrical information went in only one direction, fr om the dendrites down to the axonal tip.

Jan Evangelista Purkinje described the fi rst nerve cell in the nervous system in 1837.

Hermann von Helmholtz figured out that electrical current in the cell was not a by-product of cellular activity, but rather the medium that was actually carrying information along the axon of a nerve cell. He was also the first to suggest that invertebrates would be good models for studying vertebrate brain mechanisms.

Sir Charles Sherrington vigorously pursued the neuron’s behavior and coined the term synapse to describe the junction betw ee n tw o neurons.

Franciscus Donders was the first to propose the now common method of using differences in reaction times to infer differences in cognitive processing.

The philosophers had two main positions: rationalism and empiricism.

* Rationalism grew out of the Enlightenment period and held that all knowledge could be gained through the use of reason alone: Truth was intellectual, not sensory. Th rough thinking, then, rationalists would determine true beliefs and would reject beliefs that, although perhaps comforting, were unsupportable and even superstitious. Among intellectuals and scientists, rationalism replaced religion and became the only way to think about the world. In particular, this view, in one form or another, was supported by René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz.

* Rationalism is frequently equated with logical thinking, the two are not identical. Rationalism considers such issues as the meaning of life, whereas logic does not. Logic relies simply on inductive reasoning, statistics, probabilities, and the like. It does not concern itself with personal mental states like happiness, self-interest, and public good. Each person weighs these issues differently, and as a consequence, a rational decision is more problematic than a simple logical decision.

* Empiricism, by contrast, is the idea that all knowledge comes fr om sensory experience, that the brain begins life as a blank slate. Direct sensory experience produces simple ideas and concepts. When simple ideas interact and become as sociated with one another, complex ideas and concepts are created in an individual’s knowledge system. John Locke, David Hume, John Stuart Mill etc.

Hermann Ebbinghaus studied **associationism** and decided that complex processes like memory could be measured and analyzed.

Edward Thorndike described his observations that a response that was followed by a reward would be stamped into the organism as a habitual response. If no reward followed a response, the response would disappear. Thus,
rewards provided a mechanism for establishing a more adaptive response.

John B. Watson proposed that psycho logy could be objective only if it was based on observable behavior. He rejected Ebbinghaus’s methods and declared that all talk of mental processes, which cannot be publicly observed, should be avoided. These ideas evolved into the methodological stance of **behaviorism**. Learning was the key, he proclaimed, and everybody had the same neural equipment on which learning could build.

Wilder Penfield became that city’s first neurosurgeon. In collaboration with Herbert Jasper, Penfield invented the Montreal procedure for treating epilepsy, in which he surgically destroyed the neurons in the brain that produced the seizures. To determine which cells to destroy, he stimulated various parts of the brain with electrical probes and observed the results on the patients—who were awake, lying on the operating table under local anesthesia only. From these observations, he was able to create maps of the sensory and motor cortices in the brain.

Donald Hebb became convinced that the workings of the brain explained behavior, and that the psychology and biology of an organism could not be separated. He noted “cells that fi re together, wire together”. He pointed
out that the brain is active all the time, not just when stimulated by an impulse, and that inputs from the outside can only modify the ongoing activity. Hebb’s theory was subsequently used in the design of artificial neural networks.

Brenda Milner became interested and was the first to provide anatomical and physiological proof that there are multiple memory systems. Miller concluded that the brain, among other things, is an information processor and, breaking the bonds of behaviorism, he realized that the contents of the mind could be studied, setting into motion the “cognitive revolution.”

John von Neumann wrote the Silliman lectures on neural organization, in which he considered the possibility that the brain’s computational activities were similar to a massively parallel computer.

Noam Chomsky showed how the sequential predictability of speech follows from adherence to grammatical, not probabilistic, rules. Deep message is that **learning theory** could in no way explain how children learned language. The complexity of language was built into the brain, and it ran on rules and principles that transcended all people and all languages. It was innate and it was universal.

Cognitive neuroscience = insalata mista (“mixed salad”) of different disciplines.

Goldman-Rakic discovered that individual cells in the prefr ontal cortex are dedicated to specific memory tasks, such as remembering a face or a voice. She also performed the fi rst studies on the infl uence of dopamine on the prefr ontal cortex. Her fi ndings caused a phase shift in the understanding of many mental illnesses—including schizophrenia, which previously had bee n thought to be the result of bad parenting.

Changes in electrical impulses, fluctuations in blood flow, and shifts in utilization of oxygen and glucose are the driving forces of the brain’s business. They are also the parameters that are measured and analyzed in the various methods used to study how mental activities are supported by brain functions.

* Electroencephalography: recordings of the electrical activity.
* Measuring Blood Flow in the Brain: measurable physical parameters such as diff usion, solubility , and perfusion.
* Computerized Axial Tomography: a series of transverse X-rays could be reconstructed into a three -dimensional picture.
* Positron Emission Tomography and Radioactive Tracers: noninvasive sectioning technique that could provide information about function.
* Magnetic Resonance Imaging: anatomical images
* Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: detailed images of the body with physiology related to brain function, and it is sensitive.
