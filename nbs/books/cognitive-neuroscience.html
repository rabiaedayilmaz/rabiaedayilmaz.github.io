<p>The scientific field of cognitive neuroscience received its name in the late 1970s (cognition - process of knowing, neuroscience - the study of how nervous system is organized and functions). The ancient Greeks who made the theoretical leap to the view that we are separate fr om the world we occupy. Thales represented <em>monism</em> flesh-and-blood brain produces thoughts, however Descartes represented <em>dualism</em> body is like a machine and mind is nonmaterial, also influences body. Cognitive neuroscience takes Thales’ perspective: conscious mind is a product of the brain’s physical activity and not seperate from it.</p>
<p>Thomas Willis foreshadowed cognitive neuroscience with the notion that isolated brain damage (biology) could affect behavior (psychology), but his insights slipped from view. So, he is the first one that showed brain damage can influence behavior and cerebral cortex might what makes us human.</p>
<p>Joseph Gall became convinced that the brain was the organ of the mind and that innate faculties were localized in specific regions of the cerebral cortex. He thought that the brain was organized around some 35 or more specific functions, ranging from cognitive basics such as language and color perception to more ephemeral capacities such as affection and a moral sense, and that each was supported by specific brain regions.</p>
<p>Gall believed that a careful analysis of the skull could go a long way in describing the personality of the person inside the skull. Gall called this technique anatomical personology -&gt; phrenology.</p>
<p>Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens destroyed parts of the brains of pigeons and rabbits and observed what happened. deducted the notion that the whole brain participated in behavior -&gt; aggregate field theory. He wrote “All
sensations, all perceptions, and all volitions occupy the same seat in these (cerebral) organs. The faculty of sensation, percept and volition is then essentially one faculty.”</p>
<p>John Hughlings Jackson began to publish his observations on the behavior of persons with brain damage. He proposed topographic organization in the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Paul Broca had a patient Tan. He could understand language, but “tan” was the only word he could utter. Broca found that Tan had a syphilitic lesion in his left -hemisphere inferior frontal lobe. Th is region is now called Broca’s area.</p>
<p>Carl Wernicke reported on a stroke victim who (unlike Broca’s patient) could talk quite freely but made little sense when he spoke. Wernicke’s patient also could not understand spoken or written language. He had a lesion in a more posterior region of the left hemisphere, an area in and around where the temporal and parietal lobes meet, now referred to as Wernicke’s area.</p>
<p>Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig electrically stimulated discrete parts of a dog brain and observed that this stimulation produced characteristic movements in the dog.</p>
<p>Germans neuroanatomists analyze the brain by using microscopic methods to view the cell types in different brain regions. Perhaps the most famous of the group was Korbinian Brodmann, who analyzed the cellular organization of the cortex and characterized 52 distinct regions. Then, he published his cortical maps in 1909.</p>
<p>Brodmann used tissue stains that permitted him to visualize the different cell types in diff erent brain regions. How cells diff er between brain regions is called cytoarchitectonics, or cellular architecture.</p>
<p>Camillo Golgi developed one of the most famous cell stains in the history of the world: the silver method for staining neurons—la reazione nera, “the black reaction”—which impregnated individual neurons with silver chromate. This stain permits visualization of individual neurons in their entirety. Golgi had believed that
the whole brain was a syncytium, a continuous mass of tissue that shares a common cytoplasm.</p>
<p>Using Golgi’s method, Santiago Ramón y Cajal went on to find that neurons were discrete entities. Ramón y
Cajal, who some call the father of modern neuroscience, was the first to identify the unitary nature of neurons and to articulate what came to be known as the neuron doctrine, the concept that the nervous system
is made up of individual cells. He also recognized that the transmission of electrical information went in only one direction, fr om the dendrites down to the axonal tip.</p>
<p>Jan Evangelista Purkinje described the fi rst nerve cell in the nervous system in 1837.</p>
<p>Hermann von Helmholtz figured out that electrical current in the cell was not a by-product of cellular activity, but rather the medium that was actually carrying information along the axon of a nerve cell. He was also the first to suggest that invertebrates would be good models for studying vertebrate brain mechanisms.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Sherrington vigorously pursued the neuron’s behavior and coined the term synapse to describe the junction betw ee n tw o neurons.</p>
<p>Franciscus Donders was the first to propose the now common method of using differences in reaction times to infer differences in cognitive processing.</p>
<p>The philosophers had two main positions: rationalism and empiricism.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Rationalism grew out of the Enlightenment period and held that all knowledge could be gained through the use of reason alone: Truth was intellectual, not sensory. Th rough thinking, then, rationalists would determine true beliefs and would reject beliefs that, although perhaps comforting, were unsupportable and even superstitious. Among intellectuals and scientists, rationalism replaced religion and became the only way to think about the world. In particular, this view, in one form or another, was supported by René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz.</p></li>
<li><p>Rationalism is frequently equated with logical thinking, the two are not identical. Rationalism considers such issues as the meaning of life, whereas logic does not. Logic relies simply on inductive reasoning, statistics, probabilities, and the like. It does not concern itself with personal mental states like happiness, self-interest, and public good. Each person weighs these issues differently, and as a consequence, a rational decision is more problematic than a simple logical decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Empiricism, by contrast, is the idea that all knowledge comes fr om sensory experience, that the brain begins life as a blank slate. Direct sensory experience produces simple ideas and concepts. When simple ideas interact and become as sociated with one another, complex ideas and concepts are created in an individual’s knowledge system. John Locke, David Hume, John Stuart Mill etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hermann Ebbinghaus studied <strong>associationism</strong> and decided that complex processes like memory could be measured and analyzed.</p>
<p>Edward Thorndike described his observations that a response that was followed by a reward would be stamped into the organism as a habitual response. If no reward followed a response, the response would disappear. Thus,
rewards provided a mechanism for establishing a more adaptive response.</p>
<p>John B. Watson proposed that psycho logy could be objective only if it was based on observable behavior. He rejected Ebbinghaus’s methods and declared that all talk of mental processes, which cannot be publicly observed, should be avoided. These ideas evolved into the methodological stance of <strong>behaviorism</strong>. Learning was the key, he proclaimed, and everybody had the same neural equipment on which learning could build.</p>
<p>Wilder Penfield became that city’s first neurosurgeon. In collaboration with Herbert Jasper, Penfield invented the Montreal procedure for treating epilepsy, in which he surgically destroyed the neurons in the brain that produced the seizures. To determine which cells to destroy, he stimulated various parts of the brain with electrical probes and observed the results on the patients—who were awake, lying on the operating table under local anesthesia only. From these observations, he was able to create maps of the sensory and motor cortices in the brain.</p>
<p>Donald Hebb became convinced that the workings of the brain explained behavior, and that the psychology and biology of an organism could not be separated. He noted “cells that fi re together, wire together”. He pointed
out that the brain is active all the time, not just when stimulated by an impulse, and that inputs from the outside can only modify the ongoing activity. Hebb’s theory was subsequently used in the design of artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>Brenda Milner became interested and was the first to provide anatomical and physiological proof that there are multiple memory systems. Miller concluded that the brain, among other things, is an information processor and, breaking the bonds of behaviorism, he realized that the contents of the mind could be studied, setting into motion the “cognitive revolution.”</p>
<p>John von Neumann wrote the Silliman lectures on neural organization, in which he considered the possibility that the brain’s computational activities were similar to a massively parallel computer.</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky showed how the sequential predictability of speech follows from adherence to grammatical, not probabilistic, rules. Deep message is that <strong>learning theory</strong> could in no way explain how children learned language. The complexity of language was built into the brain, and it ran on rules and principles that transcended all people and all languages. It was innate and it was universal.</p>
<p>Cognitive neuroscience = insalata mista (“mixed salad”) of different disciplines.</p>
<p>Goldman-Rakic discovered that individual cells in the prefr ontal cortex are dedicated to specific memory tasks, such as remembering a face or a voice. She also performed the fi rst studies on the infl uence of dopamine on the prefr ontal cortex. Her fi ndings caused a phase shift in the understanding of many mental illnesses—including schizophrenia, which previously had bee n thought to be the result of bad parenting.</p>
<p>Changes in electrical impulses, fluctuations in blood flow, and shifts in utilization of oxygen and glucose are the driving forces of the brain’s business. They are also the parameters that are measured and analyzed in the various methods used to study how mental activities are supported by brain functions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Electroencephalography: recordings of the electrical activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Measuring Blood Flow in the Brain: measurable physical parameters such as diff usion, solubility , and perfusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Computerized Axial Tomography: a series of transverse X-rays could be reconstructed into a three -dimensional picture.</p></li>
<li><p>Positron Emission Tomography and Radioactive Tracers: noninvasive sectioning technique that could provide information about function.</p></li>
<li><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging: anatomical images</p></li>
<li><p>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: detailed images of the body with physiology related to brain function, and it is sensitive.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="tip admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Think About It</p>
<p>a) Can we study how the mind works without studying the brain?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We can since mind does not leave a trace in terms of just physiologically but also behavirol and cognitive psychology that focus on how people think, learn and behave. But further investigation understanding the brain’s structure and functions maintain its importance.
b) Will modern brain-imaging experiments become the new phrenology?</p></li>
<li><p>No because phrenology is a pseudo-scientific practice and claims to be able to determine the character, personality and mental abilities based on the shape and size of the skull. It is not based on science and evidence. In contrast, modern brain imaging techniques use such as fMRI and PET that visualize and measure brain activity. They investigate specific cognitive processes and neural mechanisms to understand behavior and mental states by being statistically robust and reliable.
c) How do you think the brain might be studied in the future?</p></li>
<li><p>I think that future will enable us to experiment brain not just in vivo but also in silico with the improvements of artifical intelligence. On the other hand, there are four major topics that are expected to be developed over the time largely. They are brain imaging, brain-machine interfaces, artifical intelligence, optogenetics(controlling neuron and brain activity by using light) and brain simulation.
d) Why do good ideas and theories occasionally get lost over the passage of time? How do they often get rediscovered?</p></li>
<li><p>It happens often to ignore the outcomes or rediscovering them. Because at that time, the importance of the outcome may not well understood or could not be concluded in a such way to unlock more unknown. The key reasons are lack of documentation, lack of interest, lack of accessability etc.</p></li>

<h3><span class="section-number">2.1.2. </span>Structure and Function of Nervous System<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-and-function-of-nervous-system" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Nervous system has two core cell types: neurons and glial cells. Neurons are basic signaling units and transmit information throughout nervous system. They vary due to their function. Glial cells provide structural support and electrical insulation to neurons and modulating neuronal activity. There are three major types of glial cells: astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes.</p>
<p>Astrocytes are large, surrounding neurons and close contact with brain’s vasculature. They create a barrier, blood-brain barrier. It restricts the diffusion of microscopic objects (such as bacteria, pathogen, chemical compounds) and large hydrophilic molecules in the blood from entering the neural tissue. They respond to and release neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Glial cells have fatty substance called myelin. In the central nervous system oligodendrocytes form myelin and in the peripheral nervous system Schwann cells form myelin. They wrap the axon and creates myelin that is good electric insulator and prevents electrical loss(increase in speed and distance).</p>
<p>Microglial cells are small and irregular shaped. They are phagocytes devour and remove damaged cells. They can proliferate even in the adults.</p>
<p>Nodes of Ranvier are where myelin has gaps and voltage gated Na+ and K+.</p>
<p>Soma (Greek - body) is the cell body and it contains nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoskeleton, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus etc. They are in the cytoplasm that is salty fluid containing ions of potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium and molecules like protein. Neurons have two structure: dendrites (branching extensions) and axons (output side). Synapse is where two neurons contact.</p>
<p>Presynaptic neuron is when their axon’s output synapses make connections onto another neuron.
Postsynaptic neuron is when other neurons make a connection at input synapses.</p>
<p>The process of signaling has several stages. First, energy is needed to generate the signals. Second, this energy is in the form of an electrical potential across the neuronal membrane (difference in voltage). Third, these two voltages are depended on the concentrations of potassium, sodium and chloride ions. Fourth, when a neuron is in resting state, the inside of the neuron is charged more negatively (about 70 mV-resting potential). The neuronal membrane has ion channels and pumps. Ion channels are passive (always open) or gated (stimulation needed electrical, chemical, physical etc.)
Action potentials are all or none due to the threshold. Postsynaptic potentials lead to action potentials and can be measured with EEG etc.</p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are synthesized by and localized within the presynaptic neuron, and stored in the presynaptic
terminal before release. It is releasedby the presynaptic neuron when action potentials depolarize with Ca+2. Some neurotransmitters are amino acids (aspartate, gamma amynobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and glycine), biogenic amines (dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine [three of them aka catecholamines], serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and histamine), asethylcholine (ACh), neuropeptides(large molecules, strings of amino acids). Neuropeptides are tachykinins (brain-gut peptides), neurohypophyseal hormones (oxytocin, vazopressin), hypothalamic releasing hormones (corticotropine hormones like somatostatin/stress, gonadotropin/growth inhibitor), opioid peptides (like drug, yes, endorphins and enkaphalins) and others(insulin, secretin etc.).</p>
<p>Chemical transmission results in release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic neuron and binding of those neurotransmitters on the postsynaptic neuron. After binding neurotransmitters must be removed from the receptor. This can be achieved by reuptake back into the presynaptic terminal, enzymatic breakdown or diffusion.</p>
<p>Electrical synapses are different from chemical synapses. Because they operate by passing current directly from one neuron (presynaptic) to another neuron (postsynaptic) via specialized channels.</p>
<p>Two main division of nervous system: centralnervous system (CNS, brain+spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system (PNS, nerves+ganglia). PNS deliverssensory information to CNS. This is achieved by two subsystems: somatic motor system (voluntary muscles) and autonomic motor system (automated visceral functions).</p>
<p>Autonomic motor system has two branches: sympathetic (norepinephrine, fight or flight) and parasympathetic (acetylcholine, uwu peace).</p>
<p>CNS formed by brain and spinal cord. Each is covered with protection membranes that is called meninges. Meninges has three layers: dura mater (outer), arachnoid mater (middle) and pia mater (inner). Between arachnoid and pia mater, it is filled with a fluid that is called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The brain actually floats in CSF (for pressure and damage).</p>
<p>The brain needs energy and oxygen (from blood). Approximately 20% of blood flow of the heart is supplied to brain.</p>
<p>Guide to navigate to brain:
dorsal
rostral (eye)       (nape) caudal
ventral</p>
<p>The brainstem = medulla(vital functions), pons(REM sleep, eye movements) and midbrain. Cerebellum.
The diencephalon = thalamus and hypothalamus. Pituiary gland, amygdala.
Telencephalon = cerebrum.</p>
<p>Limbic system = hypothalamus, thalammus, amygdala and hypocampus. Behavioural and emotional responses.</p>
<p>Basal ganglia = caudate nucleus, putamen/striatum, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra. Motivation and learning. Reward-based learning and goal-oriented behavior. Timing and task-switching.</p>
<p>Dividing cortex by function: frontal lobe (motor cortex), parietal lobe (somatosensory area), occipital lobe (visual processing areas), temporal lobe (auditory processsing area).</p>
<p>The wrinkled/folded structure of the brain = gyri (bumps) and sulci (groove).</p>
<p>Evolution of the brain: minimizing connection lengths and a small number of long connections.</p>
<p>New neurons form through the life in certain brain regions. (neurogenesis)</p>
<div class="tip admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Think About It</p>
<p>a) If action potentials are all or none, how does the nervous system code differences in sensory stimulus amplitudes?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Amplitudes of the sensory stimuli vary due to frequency and total number of action potentials.
b) What property (or properties) of ion channels makes them selective to only one ion, such as K+, and not another, such as Na+? Is it the size of the channel, other factors, or a combination?</p></li>
<li><p>The selectivity of the ion channels are determined by the size, shape and charge distribution of the channel pore.
c) Given that synaptic currents produce electrotonic potentials that are decremental, how do inputs located distantly on a neuron’s dendrites have any influence on the firing of the cell?</p></li>
<li><p>Neurons are not passive cables, so neuron’s soma can still have influence on the firing cell.
d) What would be the consequence for the activity of a postsynaptic neuron if reuptake or degradation systems for neurotransmitters were damaged?</p></li>
<li><p>Then, neurotransmitters could not be removed, it can affect the activity of the postsynaptic neuron and long term neural circuit. And it may lead some consequences: increased excitability, neurotransmitter depletion, altered synaptic plasticity,neurological disorders.
e) What are glial cells, and what functions do they perform?</p></li>
<li><p>They are non neural cell that are responsible for transmitting electrical and chemical signals in the nervous system. They have propoerties such as blood brain barrier (astrocytes), myelin&amp;Schawann cells (oligodendricytes), immune by removing damaged cells (microglia) etc.
f) Which region of the cerebral cortex has increased in size the most across species during evolution? What function does this brain region carry out in humans that is absent or reduced in animals?</p></li>
<li><p>It is prefrontal cortex. Its tasks include working memory, decision making, planning, attention, social behavior. In humans it is essential as it enables us to carry out complex tasks. In animals it is less developed.
g) How do the factors of brain size, neuron number, and connectivity contribute to human cognitive capacity ?</p></li>
<li><p>Brain size may be coralated with increased cognitive capacity since it enables to have larger space to more cortical areas. Neuron number is the key determinant of cognitive capacity because it provides to achieve more complex tasks. Complexity and density of connectivity contributes a lot to cognitive capacity.
h) What brain areas have been associated with the creation of new neurons, and what functions are they
thought to perform?</p></li>
<li><p>This process is called neurogenesis. The regions of brain that have neurogenesis are: hyppocampus (learning, memory, spatial navigation), subventricular zone (migrates to olfactory bulb, odor perception), olfactory bulb.</p></li>
